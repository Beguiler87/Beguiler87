I'm Andrew and I have been exploring the world of code. Following an unexpected layoff in March of 2025, I decided to take some time to learn something new. I had worked closely with some of the developers in my previous employment and decided that I wanted to explore their skillset. Using Boot.dev, I learned a great deal about multiple languages and development tools. Python is my language of choice, but I'm familiar with Go as well.
